#City Traffic Simulation System

#Project Description:

The City Traffic Simulation System aims to simulate the dynamics of a cityâ€™s traffic flow, focusing on the interactions between different vehicles,
 traffic lights, and pedestrian crossings. The project will model various elements of city traffic, such as cars, buses, motorcycles, traffic lights, and
  pedestrian crossings. The simulation will emulate how vehicles navigate through intersections, obey traffic signals, and how traffic congestion forms and dissipates over time.

This project will demonstrate how various objects in a real-world city environment interact, making it a perfect fit for applying Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
It will simulate scenarios like traffic jams during peak hours, smooth traffic flow during off-peak hours, and the impact of pedestrian crossings on vehicular traffic.


#Programming Language:

The project will be implemented using C++.
